# observability-ui

This is a Next.js project. We use Shadcn UI components as base components, located in `components/ui` and added automatically through `npx shadcn@latest add` commands. Run `npm run dev` to run dev server locally. To select colors for the theme, visit https://ui.shadcn.com/colors for tailwind-grade colors in HSL format. When installing packages, use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag.
